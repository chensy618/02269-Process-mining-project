Analyze data from DTU's students curricula (difficulty multiplier: 1)
Recently, DTU prepared a database with data from 22086 students (with 327248 events) for Danmarks Statistik. The dataset is anonymized so it can be shared (dataset available here https://dtudk-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/andbur_dtu_dk/EexamyuXuJNCgnZZZQB1ISYBr5tFx3r9nBNOh7mWlZMueg?e=k1FLY0)
Looking at each study plan as a process and doing process mining on it can help reveal where the bottlenecks are, if certain prerequisites are not necessary, whether certain grades correlate with certain curriculum structure, etc
Data from the very interesting project DTU Course Analyzer (https://github.com/SMKIDRaadet/dtu-course-analyzer) might be integrated too
